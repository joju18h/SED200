# Sustaining Software Engineering and Product Support

- Product support and sustaining engineering involve improving products after release to address defects and evolving customer needs.
- Software defects and feature enhancements are common after product release.


## Sustaining Software Ecosystems
- Traditional software development focuses on projects with clear scope, participants, effort, and time constraints.
- Software ecosystems challenge this model as products are customizable and configurable.
- Ecosystems involve diverse design constituencies, including 3rd-party developers and local designers.
- Technical interfaces between design constituencies are essential but often contested.
- Development happens in overlapping cycles to accommodate various evolution drivers.
- Successful software products evolve to remain useful and attractive over time.

## Examples of Evolving Software Ecosystems
1. **UIQ Technology:** Developed a user interface framework and apps for mobile devices.(Based on symbian OS) Failed due to challenges in maintaining the ecosystem.
2. **Microsoft Dynamics:** Developed ERP systems adaptable to various markets. It's called dynamics NAV. The term "framework" refers to the programming tools used to build the app. The ecosystem of Dynamics Nav involves various components, like development tools and partners, working together to make the ERP system functional and customizable.
3. **SIM - Water and Environment Simulation:** Offers consultancy and software services for water and environmental issues. Water and Environment Simulation2 (SIM) is a Danish organization that offers water and environmental consultancy and software services.  The software models water flow using equations and helps engineers analyze and manage water systems. Differential equations describe how the system changes over time. The software has evolved to support real-time control systems for water management.Evolved to support control systems.
4. **UIB - Software Distribution for Local Area Networks:** Developed open-source software for software distribution in networks.


## Key Concepts and Questions
- **Sustaining engineering** is the process of improving products after release to address defects and evolving customer needs.
- Ecosystem (in general use) a complex network or interconnected system.
- **Ecosystem** in the software context refers to the complex network of interactions, contributors, and components surrounding a software product.
- Examples of successful software products evolving over decades include operating systems like Windows, Unix, or Linux.
- UIQ Technology failed due to fragmentation in the Symbian ecosystem, competition from newer platforms like iOS and Android, high licensing costs, performance issues, and an inability to adapt to changing market trends.
- considering the strong presence of well-established platforms like iOS and Android, the likelihood of SymbianOS making a significant resurgence remains quite low.
- An Application Programming Interface (API) is like a set of rules that let different computer programs talk to each other and share information easily. It's like a bridge that helps them work together without needing to know all the details about each other.
- The concept of "Inheritance" in C++ object-oriented programming works well for software frameworks. It lets you build new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and structured development.
- The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of tools in the Windows SDK for creating efficient Windows components, especially those using COM.
- The Asio C++ Library is used for network and asynchronous I/O tasks, making it easier to build efficient network applications.
- Question: Can you think of another application for water simulation?
Water simulation can also be used for urban planning and flood management, helping design drainage systems and assess flood risks in cities.
-Question: Would the Software Defined Network approach be useful for the control and routing of water?
Yes, the Software Defined Network (SDN) approach could be adapted to control and optimize water flow in systems by centralizing control and dynamically managing water routing based on real-time data just like network packets. However, there are challenges due to the physical nature of water systems that would need careful consideration.
-Question: What are some advantages of open-source software development?
Open-source software development offers collaboration, transparency, cost savings, customization, community support, rapid evolution, vendor independence, innovation, longevity, and ethical alignment.
-Question: What are some advantages of proprietary software?
Advantages of proprietary software include vendor support, stability, integration, advanced features, security (debated), ease of use, regulatory compliance, focused roadmaps, intellectual property protection, and monetization opportunities.
- The frequency of introducing novel products varies based on market dynamics and the company's strategy.

## Conclusion
- Software ecosystems challenge traditional software engineering assumptions.
- Commonalities among evolving software products include innovation across the ecosystem, maintaining contact with users, and balancing different development drivers.
- Challenges include managing evolving interfaces, accommodating overlapping development cycles, and documenting continuous development.
- Projects still exist for temporary closure but are no longer the sole framework for software development.
