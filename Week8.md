# Sustaining Software Engineering and Product Support

- Product support and sustaining engineering involve improving products after release to address defects and evolving customer needs.
- Software defects and feature enhancements are common after product release.


## Sustaining Software Ecosystems
- Traditional software development focuses on projects with clear scope, participants, effort, and time constraints.
- Software ecosystems challenge this model as products are customizable and configurable.
- Ecosystems involve diverse design constituencies, including 3rd-party developers and local designers.
- Technical interfaces between design constituencies are essential but often contested.
- Development happens in overlapping cycles to accommodate various evolution drivers.
- Successful software products evolve to remain useful and attractive over time.

## Examples of Evolving Software Ecosystems
1. **UIQ Technology:** Developed a user interface framework and apps for mobile devices. Failed due to challenges in maintaining the ecosystem.
2. **Microsoft Dynamics:** Developed ERP systems adaptable to various markets. Customization is done by partners.
3. **SIM - Water and Environment Simulation:** Offers consultancy and software services for water and environmental issues. Evolved to support control systems.
4. **UIB - Software Distribution for Local Area Networks:** Developed open-source software for software distribution in networks.

## Key Concepts and Questions
- **Ecosystem** in the software context refers to the complex network of interactions, contributors, and components surrounding a software product.
- Examples of successful software products evolving over decades include operating systems like Windows, Unix, or Linux.
- The frequency of introducing novel products varies based on market dynamics and the company's strategy.

## Conclusion
- Software ecosystems challenge traditional software engineering assumptions.
- Commonalities among evolving software products include innovation across the ecosystem, maintaining contact with users, and balancing different development drivers.
- Challenges include managing evolving interfaces, accommodating overlapping development cycles, and documenting continuous development.
- Projects still exist for temporary closure but are no longer the sole framework for software development.
